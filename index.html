    <h2> Eniac: 1946 </h2>
    <p> Also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the Eniac was
      built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 for the war effort. it was the first large-scale
      computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For about
      a decade, up until a lightning strike in 1955, ENIAC may have run more calculations than all
      mankind had done up to that point. Today, it is difficult to imagine how we could manage without
      the electronic devices that descend from the ENIAC. From our smartphones, touch screens,
      and tiny cameras to our automobiles, airplanes and medical equipment and devices,
      electronics is the engine driving us forward.</p>

  <div class="ERA-1101">
    <h2> ERA-1101: 1950's </h2>
    <p> The ERA 1101 was a computer system designed by the Engineering Research Associates and built by the Remington Rand corporation
      in the 1950's. It was the first stored program computer in the U.S. that was moved from its site of manufacture and successfully installed
      at a distant site.  The computer's first customer was the U.S. Navy.  The ERA 1101 was meant for high-speed computing and storing 1 million
      bits on its magnetic drum, one of the earliest magnetic storage devices, and a technology which ERA had done much to
      perfect in its own laboratories.  Remington Rand used the 1101's architecture as the basis for a series of machines into the 1960's.  </p>

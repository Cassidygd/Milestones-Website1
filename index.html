      <h2> Eniac: 1946 </h2>
      <p> Also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the Eniac was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 for the war
        effort. it was the first large-scale computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts.  It was also able to solve
        "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.For about a decade, up until a lightning strike in 1955, ENIAC may have run more
        calculations than all mankind had done up to that point. Today, it is difficult to imagine how we could manage without the electronic devices
        that descend from the ENIAC. From our smartphones, touch screens, and tiny cameras to our automobiles, airplanes and medical equipment and
        devices, electronics is the engine driving us forward into the future.</p>

    <div class="ERA-1101">
      <h2> ERA-1101: 1950's </h2>
      <p> The ERA 1101 was a computer system designed by the Engineering Research Associates and built by the Remington Rand corporation
        in the 1950's. It was the first stored program computer in the U.S. that was moved from its site of manufacture and successfully installed
        at a distant site. The computer's first customer was the U.S. Navy. The ERA 1101 was meant for high-speed computing and storing 1 million
        bits on its magnetic drum, one of the earliest magnetic storage devices, and a technology which ERA had done much to
        perfect in its own laboratories. Remington Rand used the 1101's architecture as the basis for a series of machines into the 1960's. The
        ERA-1101 was significant in that it helped to speed up computing and storing more information on a smaller platform. </p>

      <h2>Apple Macintosh: 1984</h2>
      <p>In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh computer after debuting a commercial for it not long before that aired during the Superbowl.
        The Macintosh was the first successful mouse-driven computer with a graphical user interface. The price of this computer was $2,500.
        Applications that came as part of the package included MacPaint, which made use of the mouse, and MacWrite, which demonstrated WYSIWYG word
        processing. The screen itself was only 9 inches, and included hardware that cost well over three times the amount it costs to buy the
        computer. The development of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984 has contributed to every advancement in technology, with the continuous
        downsize of computers, laptops, and cellphones to legacy-free computers and desktop publishing.</p>

      <h2>The World Wide Web: 1990</h2>
      <p>English physicist and programmer, Tim Berners-Lee, submitted two proposals for what will become the Web in early 1989 at the world's biggest
        physics labratory. Neither of his proposals were approved, yet he presevered and kept working on the Web with the help of his boss, Robert
        Cailliau. By Christmas of 1990, he had a prototype of the "World Wide Web". It features a server, URLs, HTML, and the first browser. The
        browser also doubles as an editor, that reflects his original idea of the web also including personal and authoring organization. The web was
        originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes
        around the world. Overall, the World Wide Web has helped technology get to where it is today by distributing information about anything and
        everything, and making the said information more accessible around the world.</p>

      <h2>Mosaic: 1993</h2>
      <p>Mosaic was the first web browser to be supported by a major institution. The browser was written by UNIX expert Eric Bina and student
        Marc Andreessen at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Mosaic was one of the most reliable browsers that, at the time,
        could be easily installed by amateurs, and allowed for images to be seen on the web page instead of being in a different window. The browser
        also featured a new form of a hyperlink that made it easier for the user to go from one website/document to another. Mosaic also won multiple
        technology awards, including the 1993 Product of the Year by InfoWorld magazine and 1994 Technology of the Year by IndustryWeek magazine.
        The overall significance of the Mosaic browser was that it helped to pave the way for better commerce and communication on the Internet in a
        short amount of time.</p>

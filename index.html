    <h2> Eniac: 1946 </h2>
    <p> Also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the Eniac was
      built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 for the war effort. it was the first large-scale
      computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For about
      a decade, up until a lightning strike in 1955, ENIAC may have run more calculations than all
      mankind had done up to that point. Today, it is difficult to imagine how we could manage without
      the electronic devices that descend from the ENIAC. From our smartphones, touch screens,
      and tiny cameras to our automobiles, airplanes and medical equipment and devices,
      electronics is the engine driving us forward.</p>

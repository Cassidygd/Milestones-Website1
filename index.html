  <div class="Eniac">
    <h2> Eniac: 1946 </h2>
    <p> Also known as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the Eniac was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946 for the war
      effort. it was the first large-scale computer to run at electronic speed without being slowed by any mechanical parts. For about a decade,
      up until a lightning strike in 1955, ENIAC may have run more calculations than all mankind had done up to that point. Today, it is difficult
      to imagine how we could manage without the electronic devices that descend from the ENIAC. From our smartphones, touch screens, and tiny
      cameras to our automobiles, airplanes and medical equipment and devices, electronics is the engine driving us forward.</p>

    <h2> ERA-1101: 1950's </h2>
    <p> The ERA 1101 was a computer system designed by the Engineering Research Associates and built by the Remington Rand corporation
      in the 1950's. It was the first stored program computer in the U.S. that was moved from its site of manufacture and successfully installed
      at a distant site. The computer's first customer was the U.S. Navy. The ERA 1101 was meant for high-speed computing and storing 1 million
      bits on its magnetic drum, one of the earliest magnetic storage devices, and a technology which ERA had done much to
      perfect in its own laboratories. Remington Rand used the 1101's architecture as the basis for a series of machines into the 1960's. </p>

    <h2>Apple Macintosh: 1984</h2>
    <p>In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh computer after debuting a commercial for it not long before that aired during the Superbowl.
      The Macintosh was the first successful mouse-driven computer with a graphical user interface. The price of this computer was $2,500.
      Applications that came as part of the package included MacPaint, which made use of the mouse, and MacWrite, which demonstrated WYSIWYG word
      processing. The screen itself was only 9 inches, and included hardware that cost well over three times the amount it costs to buy the
      computer. The development of the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984 has contributed to every advancement in technology, with the continuous downsize
      of computers, laptops, and cellphones to legacy-free computers and desktop publishing.</p>

    <h2>The World Wide Web: 1990</h2>
    <p>English physicist and programmer, Tim Berners-Lee, submitted two proposals for what will become the Web in early 1989 at the world's biggest
      physics labratory. Neither of his proposals were approved, yet he presevered and kept working on the Web with the help of his boss, Robert
      Cailliau. By Christmas of 1990, he had a prototype of the "WorldWideWeb".  It features a server, URLs, HTML, and the first browser.  The
      browser also doubles as an editor, that reflects his original idea of the web also including personal and authoring organization.</p>
